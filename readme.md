## NLP Techniques

This section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts in NLP, including text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization, which are crucial for preparing raw text data for machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models

Here, we explore how machine learning models can be applied to textual data. Different methods of text representation are discussed, including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.

## Word Embeddings

Word embeddings, such as those generated by Word2Vec, are explored in detail. The notebook demonstrates how to use the Gensim library to create and visualize word embeddings.

## Sequence-to-Sequence Models

This section introduces sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which are essential for tasks that involve translating one sequence to another, such as machine translation and text summarization.

## Transformer Models

The notebook concludes with an exploration of transformer models, specifically focusing on BERT, a state-of-the-art model for NLP tasks. The architecture, training process, and practical applications of transformers are discussed.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a thorough introduction to NLP and its applications in sentiment analysis, with a focus on practical implementation using Python libraries. Whether you are new to NLP or looking to deepen your understanding, this guide serves as a valuable resource.
